title: Create dynamic capture templates to use with org-protocol capture. In Windows!
categories: [Enso Launcher, Python]
---


[org-protocol](https://orgmode.org/manual/Protocols.html) offers a nice possibility to capture URLs 
along with some selected text from many web-browsers into Emacs [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) files. 
But most of the tools you can find out there allow a little control over the capture process - usually 
it is possible to put only plain text into the default capture file. Below we develop an 
[UbiquityWE](https://gchristensen.github.io/ubiquitywe/) command which allows to capture 
org-formatted text under any headline into the specified org file. If you are interested only in Ubiquity
or only in Org (or only in Windows), you may still skim through the code to find out how things work.


Work in progress...
