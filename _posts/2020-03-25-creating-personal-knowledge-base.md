Despite that there are gigabytes of writings on this topic, ranging
from the recipes of managing a bunch of markdown files on GitHub to
the manuals for setting up a local MediaWiki server, I'll describe 
a solution that works for me.

Basically, any software tool with the following four features is suitable 
for a usable knowledge base:

* Hierarchical data organization
* Hyperlinking and cross-referencing
* Tagging
* Search

Occasionally you may also need a [concept mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map) tool, and utilize an
advanced note taking system, such as the one used by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann),
which is described in the book [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34507927) (Luhmann did his
main work by elaborately wringing notes on the read material and a
sophisticated system of links and indexes to keep them together). 
Additionaly, I have
one more requirement: arbitrary documents, such as PDF files or files 
produced by concept mapping software should be easily attached and opened.
