Command interfaces - the integral part of life in 1980s -  gain a new breath with the advent of 
[Enso Launcher](https://gchristensen.github.io/enso-portable/) and 
[Ubiquity Web Extension](https://gchristensen.github.io/ubiquitywe/). Although graphical user interfaces
have opened a new world in computer industry, in certain domains text commands still offer
advantages in usability and accessibility. If your subject area could be easily formalized and you have some API
to act on, by using the tools mentioned above you can create powerful commands that will free you from 
routine GUI interactions.
